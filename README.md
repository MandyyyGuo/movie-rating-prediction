# movie-rating-prediction

## Objective
This analysis aims to tease apart what factors contribute to the classification of “good” and “bad” movies
based on their ratings. The variables we use for our prediction includes (director, gender of the director,
cast, budget and revenue). Understanding the relationship between movie quality and contributing factors
can help production companies to predict movie ratings and maximize a movie’s chance of success during
the creation phase.

## Data
We used [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) downloaded from Kaggle which contain metadata
for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset.
